title: 'Trying Awesome window manager on Ubuntu'
---

```bash
sudo apt install -y awesome

# logout and login again, select 'awesome' on the login screen options
```

- `awesome` is configured in Lua

---

UPDATE:

nevermind, i'll never use it. Because:

- i'm _VERYYY_ used to hitting the `Super` (Windows logo) key to start an app on Ubuntu. On macOS i do it by hitting `alt`+`space`. On awesome, i have no idea what it is. I'm not clicking through application menus to open something.
- i don't think it's for active GUI users, it felt more like what a sysadmin would use for _passive_ screens, the ones you just display but don't actively interact with
- It's not a tool or extension, it's an entirely different display manager. what i really needed was something that could resize and tile windows (without me having to leave everything else i have already setup)
- i had to Google how to logout
