The basic and the most common command is:

```bash
sudo mount -av
```

To make sure it reloads config for auto-mount drives as well, and when traditional `mount` is not working, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

if the above doesn't work, try:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart remote-fs.target
```

to reload an entry to mount a local filesystem:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart local-fs.target
```

If you have removed entries from `fstab` and the above commands don't work, try _restarting_ the machine.
