```bash
~ $ echo $PATH
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/aamnah/Dropbox/todo

~ $ cat /etc/paths
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin

PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH # prepend a path to your current $PATH
```

# Ubuntu
The following command adds (appends) a path to your current path:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/my/custom/path
```

If you want your setup to execute this command every time, there are a number of places where you can put it. When you login, the following scripts will be executed in this order:

```bash
/etc/profile      (which starts by loading everything in /etc/profile.d)
~/.profile        (which starts by loading ~/.bashrc if you are running bash)
```

To **overwrite an existing PATH**, use the same export command without the $PATH included in the value. Like so:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

`:` is the seperator between different PATH locations.

To **find out if a command is in the path**, use `which`. For example:

```bash
which node
```

on a Mac will give you

```
/usr/local/bin/node
```

If you get nothing from the which node coomand, node's not in the path.

### Notes

- **~/.profile** is only loaded if **~/.bash_profile** or **~/.bash_login** DO NOT EXIST. Otherwise, at least bash, will load them instead. It is suggest to use .profile and not the bash specific scripts. So, if in these attempts you created **.bash_login**, _please delete it now_.

- ~/.bashrc is only loaded if you are running an interactive session. (something with a prompt where you can actually type something.

- ~/.bashrc is loaded again and again, _everytime you open up a new terminal_. So a new tab in gnome-terminal, a new virtual terminal, etc. So even if you don't login again, .bashrc is loaded (and thereby resets its environment) everytime you open a new shell.

- Something like byobu should really go into .profile, (otherwise it won't work ;-)

- Something like paths should go into .profile if you want it to work outside of the interactive sessions. (say when you press alt+f2 in gnome)

# Mac OS X
Check what current $PATH is:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

OR

```bash
printf "%s\n" $PATH
```

You can add path to any one of the following method:

- `$HOME/.bash_profile` file using export syntax. e.g. `export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir/location1`
- `/etc/paths.d` directory.
