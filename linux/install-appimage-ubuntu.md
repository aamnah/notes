AppImage is cool because

- _one file to rule them all_
- it is distribution agnostic. same file can run on Debian and Fedora. Unlike `.deb` for Debian/Ubuntu and `.rpm` for Fedora/SUSE, you get one `AppImage` file you can run on all distribution
- it is self-container. Meaning you don't need to install it or extract it, just directly run it by double-clicking.

Installing AppImage files

- Download the file
- Make it executable
- Run by double-clicking it
