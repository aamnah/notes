Seems to be fading away after having watched videos from [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) on fundamentals of programming. Professor Brailsford is awesome. The [Python course by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and #100daysOfCode is already helping

- Maybe what I really needed was **stories instead of instructions**, I enjoy the stories
- Maybe what I really needed was to **learn slow**. Takes me around 3 hours to grasp 1 topic, or go through 1 day of code.
- Maybe what I really needed was to force myself to do **one thing at a time**
- maybe what I really needed was to accept that I am **not a genius**, and it is **hard for me to learn new things**
- maybe all I needed to know was I need **hard work instead of intelligence** this time, maybe I am not that smart
- maybe **consistency is the real key**
- maybe all I needed was to realize **I have limitations**, accept my limitations and work on my self

I feel like I have knowledge no-one else has, no lady I know in real life or on the internets that knows _origins of UNIX_ or gets excited by them as much as I do.. I'm not an imposter in my knowledge and fascination of Unix. The _fascination_ is real.

I feel like I had really great expectations from myself, and I overestimated how intelligent I am, in other words I overestimated how long it takes me to learn something

[Nag](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nag/id412155298?mt=12) is also helping me. Makes me realize how much time it takes me to finish something, and how many times I pass the 1 hour mark and are still 25% done.. Progress is slow. But slow progress is still progress!
