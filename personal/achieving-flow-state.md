title: What helps me achieve the flow state, let's me do deep work, or just be in the zone
draft: true
---

clear my schedule

### things that bring on the flow

- being bored (i.e. doing nothing for a while)
- zoning out
- turn off phone? turn internet off on phone?

clearing my desk

- thinking about the process (sit down and start writing) and not the product (write an article)
- don't think about how it'll benefit in the long run, if you enjoy it, just do it.

- _blocking_ time. can you take out 40 minutes to do nothing else? cool, set a timer for 40 minutes and just do this one thing. (pomodoro technique)

### things that'd break the flow

- eating out in a social setting
- meeting someone
- work tasks that can't be delayed (deadlines)
- notifications (social, email, text messages)

- getting overwhelmed by how much i need to learn or how much i don't know or how long it'll take to be good enough..
