There are different sizes, which have names

- Soprano (smallest, strummming)
- Concert (chords and some single notes)
- Tenor (more mid range, more bass, bit louder, longer neck is good for single notes)
- Baritone (almost guitar sized - the size of a tenor guitar, bass, louder. The string tunings change. E B G D instead of A E C G on a Tenor)

Smaller doesn't sound great, doesn't intonate (stay in tune) well
Smaller the body, the higher the pitch (more trebble)

### Lengths

between nut and saddle

13" Soprano  
14-15" Concert  
17" Tenor  
19" Baritone

longer strings give you low notes

Conclusion: Concert ukulele is a good start
