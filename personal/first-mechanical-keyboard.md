The Logitech G512 Carbon with Romer-G Linear switches.

The reason i opted for a wired keyboard and not a wireless one is because of dual-boot. I have a Windows + Ubuntu system, with Ubuntu being prefered choice. Sometimes i boot into Windows to work on legacy ASP.NET projects. Bluetooth keyboards don't get connected till after you have passed the GRUB. GRUB is that screen where you have to select between Windows and Ubuntu, and the bluetooth wireless keyboard doesn't work on it. Meaning, i can not select the OS.. I have had this issue with both of my wireless bluetooth keyboards. (Logitech K480 and Logitech diNovo). So with my mechanical keyboard, i went for a wired one.

The keys get stuck. Oddly enough, this starts happening at the end of the day, around 4pm, when i have already been using the keyboard for around 5 hours. I have looked into keyboard chatter and XXX. The common solution i cam around was _lubing_ the keys. That's a thing! So now i'm looking for a XXX based lube..

Love the sound of it. Best sound i have ever heard come out of a keyboard. And it feels amazing too. Money well spent.

This thing costes me around PRK 15,000 adn I don't have the warranty for this. Otherwise i probably would have tried to return it.

The experience of the Linear switches has been nice. The only issue is that they are maybe _too light_. The first month, i kept zooming in and out of things randomly. The shortcut for zooming in and out is Ctrl + mouse wheel. And turns out that i was pressing Ctrl with my resting finger, so whenever i tried to scroll up or down, it'd end up zooming in and out. I end up pressing keys if i rest my hand on the keyboard.. I also end up making more mistakes because the keys are actuated with very light touches. I wanted something smooth and fast, so after a lot of research
i opted for Red keys. But now i'm realizing i'm more of a Yellow/Black person.

I'm already planning my next mechanical keyboard, and i'm going to build that one myself. The switches i have in mind are Gateron Yellows, and it should work in both wired and wireless mode.
