Bought my own ukulele last week. It's a Chinese one i got from Music Mart for Rs. 5500. Originally had a _Xing Ge_ sticker which i asked the shop to remove. It looks great, has white bindings

There is a very annoying buzzing sound coming out of it when you press at different frets. And the nylon strings need to be tuned after almost every 15 minutes of playing.
