- find hacking targets
- vulnerabilities that you can exploit
- see what ports are open (default ports can tell you what services are running on these ports)

```bash
# Scan entire network (ping an entire network to see what devices are online)
nmap -sP 10.7.1.0

nmap -v -A www.badstore.net

sudo nmap -A 10.77.1.0/24
```

- `-v`: verbose output
- `-A`: Enable OS detection, version detection (for protocols), script scanning, and traceroute
- `-O`: Enable OS detection

```bash
sudo nmap -sT -p 80,443 10.7.1.0/24
```

- `sT` TCP connect, i.e. full open scan

This scanning of entire networks might be blocked by firewalls (IDS: Intrusion Detection System) and may even be illegal. so you use `-sS` instead, the `S` is for _stealthy_
