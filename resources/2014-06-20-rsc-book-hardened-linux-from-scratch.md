Hardened Linux From Scratch (HLFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized and hardened Linux system entirely from source. Based on LFS, this project will incorporate parts of BLFS as well. The main differences from these other projects will be the amount of text dealing with security configuration issues as well as patching or substituting many of the packages used for improved security.
