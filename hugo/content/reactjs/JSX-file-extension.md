# Using .jsx file extensions

When using `.jsx` file extension, you need to **specify the extension in file imports** as well. For example:

```javascript
import App from './components/App.jsx'
```

When using `.js` file extension, it just knows it's javascript and imports look a bit neater, like so:

```javascript
import App from './components/App'
```
