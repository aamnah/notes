## Configuration

configure username  

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

configure email  

```bash
git config --global user.email "me@mydomain.com"
```

check confgiuration

```bash
git config --list
```

## Repositories

Start a git repo  


```bash
git init my_new-repo
```

Start a git repo in existing folder, cd to that folder and..  


```bash
git init
```

Removing the repo = just remove the .git folder, it's the brains  

```bash
rm -r my_project/.git
``` 

where *my_project* is the project folder you are removing git from.

## Adding Code

Add files to track  

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

Add all files to track `-A`  

```bash
git add -A
```

## Committing Code

Adding a file  

```bash
git add README.md
```  

where README.md is the name of your file.  

Commit code  

```bash
git commit
```

Commit all code `-a`

```bash
git commit -a
``` 

Commit all code with a message `-m`

```bash
git commit -a -m 'your commit message'
``` 

## Check Status

show git status

```bash
git status
```

show git log for a history of commits 

```bash
git log
``` 

show details of a specific commit
_Method 1: checkout_  

```bash
git checkout commitIDENTIFIER
``` 
you dont need the whole identifer, the first 5 letters would usually do.

go back to where you were after checking out a commit 

```bash
git checkout master
```

master is the branch you were previously on before checking out the commit.

_Method 2: diff_
check difference between two commits

```bash
git diff commit1 commit2
```

## Removing code

To remove files/folders from a git repo

```bash
git rm filename.txt
``` 

OR 

```bash
git rm -r directory/cache
```

Use `-f` flag if you have to force it. It is recommended to add files you don't want in the repo to .gitignore so they don't get added in the first place.

## Delete branches

delete a branch locally 

```bash
git branch -d FOO
git branch --delete FOO

git branch -D FOO
git branch --delete --force FOO
``` 

`-d` is the same as `--delete` and `-D` is the same as `--delete --force`

`-D` or `--delete` will delete the branch locally. you can't delete the branch you are in, it'll ask you to switch before deleting.

delete a remote branch

```bash
git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>

git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>
```

Branches
---
Bracnhes are like alternate realities for your repositry. They let you pursue different courses of action on your project in parallel.

Check what branch you are in  

```bash
git status
```

Create a new branch  

```bash
git branch branchName
```

Switch to a branch  

```bash
git checkout branchName
```

Switch back to master branch  

```bash
git checkout master
```

Switch and create branch in the same command  

```bash
git checkout -b newFeature
```

`-b` flag will create the branch if it doesnt already exists. 

show bracnhes  

```bash
git branch
```

`*` asterisk indicates what branch you're currently on.

Merging
---
Merge a branch  

```bash
git merge branchName
``` 

after manually taking care of merge conflicts,

```bash
git add conflictedFile
``` 

and then

```bash
git commit
``` 

Cloning
---

```bash
git clone remoteRepo  yourNewRepoName
``` 

Working with Remotes  
---

show list of remote repos  

```bash
git remote
``` 

add remote repo

```bash
git remote add NameForRemote Location/url_of_remote
``` 

add github repo  

```bash
git remote add origin github_url
``` 

the name doesn't have to be _origin_, it's just convention to name it that

push changes to remote  

```bash
git push -u origin  master
``` 

`origin` is the name of remote repo and `master` is the branch.  

Git Flow
---
installing git-flow on Linux 

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-flow
``` 

start git flow  


```bash
git flow init
```  

start git flow on a new branch  


```bash
git flow Flow_banch start BranchName
``` 

close git flow on a new branch  


```bash
git flow Flow_banch finish BranchName
``` 

Starting from Scratch or Uploading an Existing Project

Screenshot taken from [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org). Use `git add -A` to add all existing files if you are pushing up an existing project.

Further Reading
---
- [Install the git-credential-osxkeychain helper](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+Git)
	- So that you don't have to enter login details everytime you push from Mac over HTTPS.
- [Set up SSH for Git and Mercurial on Mac OSX/Linux](https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=270827678)
	- So you can communicate with git server (Bitbucket) over SSH.

Notes  
---
- The most important part in the repo is the **.git** folder. The .git folder is what tracks everything. The name of the folder you initiate a git repo with/in doesn't matter. The files inside doesn't matter. Whether you delete all those files doesn't matter either. If you have the .git folder intact, you'll be able to restore all those files
- **--global** flag means that we'd like to apply these changes for all our repositories
- the answer to 'should i commit?' is 'do you have a good commit message?'
- when you add a file, git adds it to what's called the staging area.
- check [this link](https://coderwall.com/p/euwpig) for a better commit log.
- the most recent commit = **HEAD**
- the commit before the last commit = **HEAD~1**
- master is like the trunk of your project. It's usually the main code of your project that's deployed.
- when we create a branch, it starts with a copy of the branch we are in. If you are in a branch other than master, **your new branch will copy the branch you are currently in**. Consider actual tree branches, they branch out from where they are already.
