# createReducer()

```js
createReducer(initialState, {
  // object mapping action types to 'case' reducers
})
```

```js
const counterReducer = createReducer(0, {
  increment: (state, action) => state + action.payload,
  decrement: (state, action) => state - action.payload
})
```

```js
// Actions creators generated by createAction
const increment = createAction('increment')
const decrement = createAction('decrement')

const counterReducer = createReducer(0, {
  [increment]: (state, action) => state + action.payload, // reference generated action creator as a computed property
  [decrement.type]: (state, action) => state - action.payload // Typescript may want [action.type] to force compiler to compute property
})
```

- `[increment]` = computed property syntax (allows you to put an expression in brackets `[]`)
- Both `[increment]` and `[increment.type]` will work.
