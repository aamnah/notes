Modules in Python are simply Python files with the .py extension, which implement a set of functions. Modules are imported from other modules using the import command.

To import a module, we use the `import` command. There are plenty of **built-in modules** in the Python standard library. Check out the full list [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/).
