Importance of Vi

Usually the text editor we can throw on a boot disk. It's very light weight, very small in terms of memory size. 

You can actually make command line arguments from within Vi, like cerating a directory.

### Vi vs Vim
Vim is the improved version of Vi. In most distributions Vi has been replaced by Vim. Vim is backwards-compatible with Vi.

Modes:

- `i` insert mode
- `ex` ex mode
- `:` command mode

Changing modes = `esc`

yank = copy
