- The man pages are written as `nroff` files.
- The `/usr/local/man` directory is the location typically used for any locally installed packages/files.
- You can look at examples by looking at the existing manpages, (which will likely need to be uncompressed first), also read man.
- Presently many users prefer `groff` to `nroff`, `man groff` to get started
