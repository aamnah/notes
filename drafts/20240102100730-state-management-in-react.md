Building an app and need values that I should be able to use in any component, wherever i need. How do i tackle this?

Examples of global state:
- Username (will be the same across the app for the logged in user)


Ways to manage state:

- React Context
- Redux Toolkit
- Local storage

Redux Toolkit has the best debugging experience.

Local storage can make your app work offline


Save Redux store to Local storage?!
