I'll be doing 30 days (hopefully) of C#, starting with the course on Codecademy. I'll be happy if i even manage to do two weeks though. A month is a long time to plan for.

## Day 2

April 3, 2020

- Started [C# Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/0096b00d-2398-435a-82f7-3f5401408ab1/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight. They were doing a #FreeApril month.
- Finished the section on _Introducing C# and .NET_

Learned:

- difference between .NET and .NET Core
- .NET runtime - CLR and
- Setting VS Code up for C#
- Running the project with `dotnet` CLI
- General project structure

- Finished the [Working with Numbers](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/lessons/csharp-working-with-numbers/) section on Codecademy

Learned:

- different data types take different amounts of memory. Choosing a data type that takes up less memory will result in faster applications

- `int` whole numbers - 76, 2, 978, 12123
- `float`, `double`, `decimal` decimal values
  - `decimal` is the most precise. think financial applications precise - 489872.76m
  - `double` is more precise than a `float` and faster to process than a `decimal`. usually the best choice - 39.76876
  - the `m` at the end of a decimal value tells C# it's a `decimal` type and not a `double`

## Day 1

April 2, 2020

Went through the [Hello World of C#](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-sharp)

Learned:

- basic data types
- outputting stuff to the console
- reading user input from the console
- changing (casting) data types
