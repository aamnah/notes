### Logitech G512 Carbon (Romer-G Linear)

- Linear is definitely not my thing. Unintended presses even after one year of use
- Got keyboard chattering after less than 6 months of use. It does go away if i stop using the keyboard and leave it around for 8-24 hours..
- Can't customize the switches or keycaps at all after the purchase. Both the switch and the keycaps are non-standard
- The market for custom Romer-G keycaps is pretty much non-existent

![TODO: add picture of the keyboards]()

### Glorious GMMK TKL (Gateron Brown)

- Browns are just as fast with less typos
- I can now rest my fingers on the keys without accidentally triggering them. (No more zooming in and out when browsing because i accidentally pressed `Ctrl`.. )
- Lights are brighter than G512 Carbon because of the light bleed under the keys
- Takes up less space because TKL (TenKeyLess, i.e. no numpad)
- The champered silver accent around the keyboard is nice
- Fully modular keys, can hot-swap switches, no soldering required
- Cross-comaptible switches. Can use pretty much any switch from Gateron, Cherry or Kailh
- Keycaps galore. The custom keycaps market is huge for standard stem switches as compared to romer-g switches
