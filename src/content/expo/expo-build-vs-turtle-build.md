The entire pipeline including installing JDK, setting up Android SDK, the actual build of the app bundle, and uploading of the artifacts took less than 8 minutes.

```bash
# Expo build
expo build:android --release-channel production
```

```bash
# Turtle build
EXPO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=${EXPO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}
EXPO_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD=${EXPO_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD}
turtle build:android \
  --keystore-path ${EXPO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH} \
  --keystore-alias ${EXPO_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_ALIAS} \
  --public-url "${PUBLIC_URL}/android-index.json" \
  --release-channel "production"
```

### Over The Air (OTA) updates

The Over The Air (OTA) updates work by calling the URL where your app's JS bundle and assets are hosted. With apps built with `expo build`, it is hosted and handled on Expo servers. For `turtle` builds, you usually pass a `--public-url` option specifying the URL the app is supposed to call for updates.

If the `--public-url` you specified is offline or unreachable, the app could result in a blank white screen. This was the case for my app where i had set `updates.checkAutomatically` to `ON_LOAD` which basically means that it would check for updates every time the app was loaded. This combined with no error-handling for this scenario resulted in a blank white screen on app load and 500 errors in Sentry because the URL couldn't be reached

### Self-hosting and Publishing

It is possible to publish your app on Expo servers and then build it with Turtle CLI. This saves you from self-publishing the app and maintaining servers.

Instead of providing `--public-url`, you'd save `EXPO_USERNAME` and `EXPO_PASSWORD` as environment variables.

But this flow only works if you have an [Expo developer account](https://expo.io/developer-services) which is \$29/m

I'm using Netlify to self-host the app. It's an additional step in the build pipeline, but it's free to use once setup (and gives you 800 build minutes per month for automated deploys). I love Netlify!
