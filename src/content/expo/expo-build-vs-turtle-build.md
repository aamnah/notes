### Over The Air (OTA) updates

The Over The Air (OTA) updates work by calling the URL where your app's JS bundle and assets are hosted. With apps built with `expo build`, it is hosted and handled on Expo servers. For `turtle` builds, you usually pass a `--public-url` option specifying the URL the app is supposed to call for updates.

If the `--public-url` you specified is offline or unreachable, the app could result in a blank white screen. This was the case for my app where i had set `updates.checkAutomatically` to `ON_LOAD` which basically means that it would check for updates every time the app was loaded. This combined with no error-handling for this scenario resulted in a blank white screen on app load and 500 errors in Sentry because the URL couldn't be reached
