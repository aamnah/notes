For the past month or so, read the [working from home during COVID-19]() post

- revised the C# course modules on []()
- pushed major updates to the Gatsby blog including generating pages for MDX posts based on filenames instead of `path` in frontmatter. Also merged the content into one folder. So it's `content` for all of them with a folder called `personal` inside. Previously it used to be a folder called `notes` for non-personal dev notes and a folder called `blog` for personal blog posts. Having multiple folders made it difficult when building templates as i always had to apply filters on queries..
- Work included looking into SignalR connectivity issues and stuff like wildcard SSLs and custom domain names for Azure services

- Felt enlightened after finding out that sending messages to a Slack channel is as easy as posting data to a webhook using something as basic as a `curl` command. This opens up so many possibilities for scripting notifications.. I started looking into it because i wanted to send monitoring alerts for a linux server if it was running high on CPU/RAM..
- Looked into a variety of system monitoring tools. The ones that i particularly liked were `htop`, `sar`, Munin and Monit
- worked out
- practiced uke
