tl;dr:

- Application state !== remote data from a server. Remote data should be in a cache, application state should be in state (React Context is fine)
- Once you accept the above, you'll stop using Redux to store everything that comes back from the server (i.e. remote data)
- Because you stopped making a client side copy of the server side data, you no longer have to worry about your state becoming stale
- You can access the data from the SWR cache the same way you can access data from a store. Because SWR cahce is a global state object. (fyi, server side data is also called cache)
- You can use Axios with SWR, it will not force you to give it up. As a matter of fact, you can use any library you want for making HTTP requests
- With SWR, you no longer have to worry about manually updating `error`, `loading`, `success` state and write reducers for them. SWR gives you these out of the box
- SWR is only meant for reading data (GET), for other CRUD operations, you can [handle them outside SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr/discussions/364#discussioncomment-24398)
- You can use a `mutate` function to update SWR cache
- You still need global app state, (be it Redux or React Context), we just don't store remote data in it.

Basic mentality behind SWR is that **remote data is not state**, it belongs in a cache.

> "Remote data is read-only. It doesnâ€™t belong in the same location as our UI state."

If you don't keep server side data in state (making a client side copy), it won't become stale.

| Server cache                             | Local state                            |

### Bandwidth concerns

SWR is great if we're using GraphQL, because then you are not making multiple HTTP calls every time you need data, so all the _revalidating_ is _less expensive_. But if you're using plain old REST APIs with lots of HTTP requests, i wonder how much bandwidth it'll consume and if we can afford making so many calls so frequently?

### Deduping

The _key_ you pass to `useSWR`helps SWR identify our request. If the key is the same for multiple requests, only one API call will be made and all components will get the results.

> all components fetching the same data are updated when the data changes.

### Transitioning an existing app that uses Redux

You can use `onSuccess` callback on `useSWR` to [dispatch redux actions](https://github.com/vercel/swr/discussions/364#discussioncomment-24396)..

### Persisting SWR cache?

SWR is using an in-memory Map for the cache (both React and React Native). It does not save cache with AsyncStorage or MemoryStore in React Native. Right now it clears everything on hard refresh. [According to folks from Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/swr/issues/16#issuecomment-547271304), LocalStorage is IO heavy and slowed down rendering. ANd IndexedDb is async, which means SWR can not return data from cache synchronously.

With Redux, persisting is simple, you use [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist). A similar ready made solution for SWR doesn't exist yet. There is [swr-sync-storage](https://github.com/sergiodxa/swr-sync-storage) from a guy who used to work at Vercel, and it'll sync SWR cache with `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to get offline cache. But it's for web and not React Native.

tl;d: you can do it, but it'll save the entire cache and is not performant as disk IO is heavy

### Conclusion

As of now, i can't use SWR in React Native apps because a solution to persist it by synching it to `AsyncStorage` (HDD/Disk) doesn't exist (yet). So the in-memory (RAM) cache will be gone every time i exit the app. If i exit the app and the next time i open it and i'm offline, the cache will be blank and i won't have any data to make the app usable offline.

I can use it in React on the web, and i can persist it to Web `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

My ideal scenario is using SWR on the web with GraphQL API and persisting it to web storage for offline access.
