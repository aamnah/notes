The [official Redux template](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux) for Create React App includes `@reduxjs/toolkit` from the get go

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux
```

- `createReducer`
- `createAction`
- `createSlice`
- `createSelector`

### Store

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  return state
}

const store = createStore(reducer)
```

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

with Redux Toolkit

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: rootReducer })
// The store now has redux-thunk added and the Redux DevTools Extension is turned on
```

### Reducers

Plain redux

```js
const initialState = { value: 0 }

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
  if (action.type === 'counter/increment') {
    // If so, make a copy of `state`
    return {
      ...state,
      // and update the copy with the new value
      value: state.value + 1,
    }
  }
  // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
  return state
}
```

```js
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return state + action.payload
    case 'decrement':
      return state - action.payload
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Redux toolkit

```js
// when using action constants
const counterReducer = createReducer(0, {
  increment: (state, action) => state + action.payload,
  decrement: (state, action) => state - action.payload,
})
```

```js
// when using actions generated by createAction()
const increment = createAction('increment')
const decrement = createAction('decrement')

const counterReducer = createReducer(0, {
  // actions used directly as the keys here, using computed property syntax
  [increment]: (state, action) => state + action.payload,
  [decrement.type]: (state, action) => state - action.payload,
})
```
