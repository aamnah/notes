Once she takes up a task, she’ll complete it with full dedication but if her heart isn’t in to something she’ll alert someone before hand instead of dragging on the task in to oblivion.',

        'Aamnah Akram did a fantastic job for us. Our highest recommendation. We will continue to work with her on an ongoing basis. Ms Akram is very knowledgeable in Wordpress and Domain Hosting. Her english is perfect, better than 80% of my fellow Americans. Despite the time difference Aamnah was easy to get in touch with. Our project included rebuilding our main web site and 6 smaller sites. She transferred the domains for us and loaded the sites to our new VPS hostgator account. I have a working knowledge of WordPress but could not have done this without her constant help. You will not find a more qualified, professional, and helpful contractor than Aamnah Akram.',
