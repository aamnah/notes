description: Getting ready for self-isolation, and how it's going so far..
---

I have started working remotely from today because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even if i'm young and healthy and do not fit the profile of people dying, i know and love people that do fit the profile and i don't want to be the ignoramous who carried the virus to them.

So, brought my system home yesterday, spent some time setting things up, and now i'm sitting in my home office/bedroom writing this up.

Figured i'd document things as i experience them.

I am going out today though, have to meet the bestie who's leaving, and also need to pickup the eukulele. This eukulele is going to be my hobby while i work from home. Also looking forward toi some watercolor paintings..

### Cons:

- no social interaction
- i'll eat more and get phat
- eating on the keyboard =(

### Pros:

- i can hear the birds, the view out the window is green
- i can walk in the room while a course video plays in the background on speaker
- i can do squats and mini workouts to stretch
- i can eat home made food
- i can work in my pajamas
- no commute, no wasting an hour driving every day
- more focus, don't have to talk to anyone
- more privacy, my screen is nor for everyone in the office to see
- more flexibility in the start and end of work hours

### Goals

Because i have extra 2 hours in my work day now, no commute and more focus, i plan on making the most out of this self-isolation period.

- watch more entertainment, catch up on TV Shows and Movies
- do more hobbies, eukulele and watercolors
- learn more things, DevOps/Frontend/Backend
- work on my website, launch the blog and refresh the design

TODO:

- [ ] (in progress) Setup the blog site with Gatsby
- [x] get them StickerMule strickers designed (..turns out 50 means 50 copies of the _same_ sticker. I don't need to collect all logos afterall, i'll just print my own brand. Will do this after the social isolation thing is over so that it gets delivered to the office)
- [ ] add a project shot on Dribbble

## Day 5 (Saturday)

Sat 21 March, 2020

Productivity level: 100
Motivation level: 90
Brain Activity/Alertness level: 100

- Practiced playing ukulele for almost 5 hours today. Wanna know how much i practice every time? till my fingers hurt, that much. it usually happens after an hour or so. today my fingertips really hurt because i practiced longer. Practiced a new strumming pattern (down down up down up) and a new chord sequence (Am F C G). There is video evidence of the practice..
- worked around four hours in the morning on the UI for the MVP. Working over the weekend to catch up on work..
- worked out? yes. 2 sets of 11 reps, 10 kg weight.
- made a point of sitting outside on the balcony in the morning, listened to the birds. it was nice, and cloudy.
- ate scrambled eggs for breakfast, rocky road crepes for lunch.

## Day 6 (Sunday)

Sun 22 March, 2020

Productivity level: 5
Motivation level: 10
Brain Activity/Alertness level: 15

- watched _1917_ and three episodes of _The World's Most Extraordinary Homes_ (Spain, Norway, Israel)
- practiced strumming
- keep forgetting things, slept in the afternoon.
- signed up for Netflix with PTCl, and got thoroughly disappointed with Netflix. Shows me fuzzy video when i'm getting 7.3mbps speed. No playback controls to set video quality. i get that quaality depends on connection, but i'd rather set it to atleast 1080p and _wait_ for it to buffer than watch fuzzy video. And i paid for an UltraHHD subscription for nothing! The catalogue sucks so bad. HAlf of the shows i watch aren't even there. The app sucks, the playback controls suck, the catalogue sucks. I don't even care for the recommendations because i can get them for free from a listicle.
- oh wait, i had Steam downloading a game in the background. The video quality has improved a bit. I was at the 11 minutes mark when it started improving though. Still won't pay for this, because the catalogue for Pakistan sucks. and my disappointment with the app is there as well. I mean, i have watched videos from people who work at Netflix about creating software and read articles on how Netflix only hires senior developers and the app is just _meh_. Doesn't make sense.
- there aren't even proper playback controls. i can't adjust speed. had to watch over acting in slow motion.. painful.

## Day 7

Mon 23 March, 2020

Productivity level: 100
Motivation level: 80
Brain Activity/Alertness level: 100

- So far, i have avoided eating at the keyboard. Wouldn't wanna get any crumbs in my fancy mechanical keyboard.
- worked for around 6 hours before my client messaging me he thought we were off because of Pakistan Day. Dang it, i worked on a national holiday when i should have just taken the day off, and God knows i need off days. I actually _forgot_ it was Pakistan Day and a national holiday, that's what social distancing does during COVIDE-19, you lose track of days..
- Anyway, took the rest of the day off after that.
- watched an episode of _Grand Designs_. Also watched the entire season of _The Letter to the King_, was pretty disappointed in the story.
- did not work out, did not practice uke. Cooked meat though, good stuff.

- watched an episode each of _Stay Here_ and _Tidying up with Marie Kondo_
- spent hours woking on the blog. The page routes work. Also got Sass and `styled-components` going
- still annoyed with the Netflix app. The _horizontal scrolling_ is meh. I can see very little at a glance (e.g. only 5-ish episodes are listed in one view), and there are no visual sorting options.
- worked out? a little

- enjoyed an hour long call with a friend

- watched an episode of _The Final Table_ and the Fat episode of _Salt Fat Acid Heat_
- another thing missing from Netflix is viewing _History_. I forgot the series i watched yesterday..
- worked out? yes
- practiced uke? nope
- enjoyed an hour long call with a friend
- i have been having difficulty falling asleep. I think it's because of hunger, i'm not eating enough. I'm out of coffee and cream.. Anyone who really knows me knows that i survive on coffee and cream.
- More than missing the office, i missed a good steak today.
- work involved setting up a country/site selection modal that shows up on site load and asks you to pick the site you want to go to by clicking a flag. It then saves that choice in a cookie and doesn't ask you again on next visit
