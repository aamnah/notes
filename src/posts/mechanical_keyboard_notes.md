Stuff you need

- PCB ($35-$60)
- Case
- Switches
- Keycaps

## PCB

- hot swap or solder?
- RGB or no lights?
- sizes: 40%. 60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 95%

The PCB will decide which size your case would be, whether your keycaps need to account for backlight and how many keys you're going to need..

Could be _hot swap_ or normal one. Hot swap is where you don't have to solder the switches to the board.

I'm gonna go with a hot swap one, because i want to try different switches.

Definitely an RGB, because i can't touch type and need backlighting.
