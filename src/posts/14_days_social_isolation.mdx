description: Getting ready for self-isolation
---

I have started working remotely from today because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Even if i'm young and healthy and do not fit the profile of people dying, i know and love people that do fit the profile and i don't want to be the ignoramous who carried the virus to them.

So, brought my system home yesterday, spent some time setting things up, and now i'm sitting in my home office/bedroom writing this up.

Figured i'd document things as i experience them.

I am going out today though, have to meet the bestie who's leaving, and also need to pickup the eukulele. This eukulele is going to be my hobby while i work from home. Also looking forward toi some watercolor paintings..

### Cons:

- no social interaction
- i'll eat more and get phat
- eatinng on the keyboard =(

### Pros:

- i can hear the birds, the view out the window is green
- i can walk in the room while a course video plays in the background on speaker
- i can do squats and mini workouts to stretch
- i can eat home made food
- i can work in my pajamas
- no commute, no wasting an hour driving every day
- more focus, don't have to talk to anyone
- more privacy, my screen is nor for everyone in the office to see
- more flexibility in the start and end of work hours

### Goals

Because i have extra 2 hours in my work day now, no commute and more focus, i plan on making the most out of this self-isolation period.
