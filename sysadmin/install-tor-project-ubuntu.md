title: Add Tor project repo to Ubuntu
slug: install-tor-project-ubuntu

NOTE: There is a [bash script](https://github.com/aamnah/bash-scripts/blob/master/install/tor_project_ubuntu.sh) that takes care of everything in this article and more.


While most of you are familiar with Tor Browser, few are aware that it is a bundle that consists of two parts: the _browser_ and the _router_. You can use the _router_ to use commands like `tor`, `torify` and `torsocks`

1. Create a `tor.list` file inside `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`

```bash
sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
```

2. Add official project source repos to the file

```bash
# /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
deb     [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org $(lsb_release -c | cut -f2) main
deb-src [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org $(lsb_release -c | cut -f2) main
```

- `$(dpkg --print-architecture)` will give you system architecture, e.g. _amd64_ (keep in mind that Ubuntu Focal dropped support for 32-bit)
- `$(lsb_release -c | cut -f2)` will give you distribution codename, e.g. _focal_

3. Update sources and install the `tor` package

```bash
apt update
apt install apt-transport-https
apt install tor
```

4. Update config

In `/etc/tor/torrc`, uncomment the lines `#ControlPort 9051` and `#CookieAuthentication 1` and change the `CookieAuthentication` value from `1` to `0`

```bash
sed -i 's/#ControlPort 9051/ControlPort 9051/g' /etc/tor/torrc
sed -i 's/#CookieAuthentication 1/CookieAuthentication 0/g' /etc/tor/torrc

sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart
```

5. Test changing your IP

```bash
curl ifconfig.me

torify curl ifconfig.me 2>/dev/null
```

The `torify` command can be used to run any command through tor. The redirect to `/dev/null` is used because torify generates a handful of warnings on some platforms.

If all goes well, you should see the IP address youâ€™re getting after going through Tor. If not, try restarting the tor service again.
