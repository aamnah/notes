####  File Permissions


The default permission scheme should be:

- Folders `755`
- Files `644`

**Avoid** having any file or directory set to 777. `777` means global access. Usually only cache files have this permission.

Via command line you can run the following commands to change permissions recursively:

```bash
# For Directories:
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# For Files:
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```


##### Secured File Permissions for specific files

You should set these permissions

```
600 -rw-------  /home/user/wp-config.php
604 -rw----r--  /home/user/cgi-bin/.htaccess
600 -rw-------  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.ini
711 -rwx--x--x  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.cgi
100 ---x------  /home/user/cgi-bin/php5.cgi
```

Run these commands to set them. Might have to re-check the paths for php/cgi files...

```bash
chmod 604 .htaccess; 
chmod 600 wp-config.php;
chmod 600 php.ini cgi-bin/php.ini; 
chmod 711 cgi-bin/php.cgi;
chmod 100 cgi-bin/php5.cgi;

```

#### Limiting file access rights

Add the following to `.htaccess`

```apache
# SECURING wp-config.php
# http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#Securing_wp-config.php
<files wp-config.php>
order allow,deny
deny from all
</files>

# SECURING wp-includes
# http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#Securing_wp-includes
# Block the include-only files.
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]
RewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\.php$ - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\.php - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]
</IfModule>
