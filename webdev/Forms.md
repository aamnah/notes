- `label`'s `for` links to the `id` of the `input`
- You can put the `input` inside the `label` and that'll achieve the same thing in a cleaner way
- `name` is so that it exists in the DOM
- In PHP, you can access posted data with `$_POST`, where you use the `name` you used in the input field to reference the data
- Showing errors is simple, you can add a css class to the element if there is an error
