title: Developing a CSS style

- Use a naming convention (i use SUIT-CSS)
- No IDs in CSS. (Because they are specificity heavyweights)
- Class-based architecture. (Binding onto classes instead of bare HTML elements provides a more robust and scalable architecture)
- The UI architecture is based on **components**. Discrete, self-contained pieces of UI as reusable components. Instead of building pages, build modules/widgets/components
