Let's face it, it's not a bedroom. Hasn't been one for as long as i can remember. It's a _living workspace_.

Saw an Xbox One controller in gray and blue. Looked great. I can do that with the walls. Gray walls with blue accents

### Paint

- Walls: Emulsion (water-based) with matte finish
- Doors: Enamel () with matte finish

water based paint dries quicker. do it on a cold day
sand and dust before primer

### Primer

Primer is an additional step that increases the durability and finish of your paint

Goes before paint

tint the primer so it matches your new paint color.

Brighto Interior Primer is a water based wall sealer which protects against alkali and moisture. It is breathable primer which allows water vapors to evaporate. It is a top quality primer for use on masonry surfaces including concrete, brick work, plaster, cement and wall boards etc.

### Enamel vs. Emulsion

Main difference is washability

Enamel = oil (solvent) based = wood & metal, glossy
Emulsion = water based = walls. Odour-less
Plastic Emulsion = acrylic based

- Enamel may contain lead. Emulsion is more eco-friendly
- Emulsion is cheaper, enamel is expensive
- Emulsion can be scrubbed off with water and detergent. Enamel can only be removed with a solvent

### Finishes

- Matt finish, (plastic emulsion) - High Matt
- Egg shell/satin finish, - Matt
- Semi-glossy finish, and - Soft Sheen
- Glossy finish. - Gloss

Flat, Eggshell (Satin), Semigloss, Gloss

Flat is matte. Least amount of shine. Best for hiding imperfections
Satin paint will show any flaws in application (e.g. brush strokes)

### VOC

> VOCs are volatile organic compounds: chemical compounds in paints that evaporate (off-gasing) into the air of your room post-painting for months or even years after painting. That distinct paint smell? That’s, most often, from VOCs.

> These emissions can be irritating to those with health considerations such as asthma and allergies. Paints labeled low-VOC must have fewer than 50 grams of VOC per liter for flat paint finishes. Those labeled zero-VOC must have fewer than 5 grams per liter.

### Oil-Based Paint vs. Latex-Based Paint

Alkyd (or oil-based) and latex paint aren't finishes. Rather, these terms refer to what makes up the paint product: oil or water. For most interior paint projects, latex—or water-based paint—is ideal. Latex dries quickly, cleans up easily with water, and doesn't have a strong odor. Alkyd dries slower and give off a strong smell. The plus to using alkyd paint is that it provides a smoother, almost hard, enamel-like finish that resists scratching, fingerprints, and stains. This type of paint tends to stick to its surface better, so it's a good choice for rougher surfaces, furniture, and even floors.
