Getting Date
---

```bash
# Date
DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
```

This will get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Stripping spaces and replacing with underscores
---

```bash
$ str="This is just a test"
$ echo ${str// /_}
This_is_just_a_test
```

Taking it Further
---

### Make it a function
What's cooler than a bash script? A bash function! With a function, we don't have to specify script name/location every time. A bash function added to your `.bash_profile` will work globally anywhere in the Terminal. The command to run would then become like this:
    
```bash
jpost "My new post"
```

To make the script a function, all you have to do is wrap the code in `functionname() { }` like so:

```bash
jpost() {
    # code goes here
}
```

### Take options
It's be nice if you could define options for your script and specify them at runtime. Like `-t` for **Type** and `-l` for **Layout**. Maybe a `-o` for **Opening** file in Sublime Text after it has been created.

So the command would become something like this:

```bash
jpost -t=markdown -l=post -o "My new post" 
```

We can do this with the bash builtin `getopts`. Define our options like so:

```bash
while getopts "o" opt; do
    case $opt in
        o) open=1 ;;
    esac
done
```

And then modify our if statements accordingly. For example, if `-o` is provided, open the file in Sublime Text
    
```bash
# check for -o (open) argument
if [ ! -z $open ]; then
    createPost
    # Open file in Sublime Text
    open -a "Sublime Text" $FILEPATH
fi
```

### Check if File already exists
A simple `if` statement can make sure that you are not overwriting existing files.

```bash
if (-e $FILENAME ); then
    echo "File already exists!"
else
    // Run our code
fi
```

`-e` is the operator that checks if a file exists. `-s` is the operator that checks if file exists and is not empty.

### Color coded responses
A simple success or error message about the results of our command would be nice. What would be even nicer if they were red or green based on their run status.

I want it to say "File has been successfully created" (green text) when a file has been cerated without any errors. If a file already exists, it should say "File already exists!" (red text).

Let'd define some colors and use them in our script.

```bash
# COLORS
Color_Off='\033[0m'       # Text Reset
Red='\033[0;31m'          # Red
Green='\033[0;32m'        # Green
Yellow='\033[0;33m'       # Yellow

echo -e "${Green}File was succesfully CREATED${Color_Off}"
echo -e "${Red}File already EXISTS and is NOT EMPTY${Color_Off}"
echo -e "${Yellow}File already EXISTS${Color_Off}"
```

### Open the newly created file in editor
If you'd like to open all new files in your favorite editor after they are created, you can add that too. The following is what i have to open all post files in Sublime Text:

```bash
open -a "Sublime Text" $FILEPATH
```

You should add this right after the file is created in your code.
