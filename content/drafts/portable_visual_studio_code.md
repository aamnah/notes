**tl;dr**: You need to have _extracted_ VS Code, i.e. downloaded a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file, and then you need to create a `data` folder inside the extracted folder. That's it. The `data` folder will hold all your extensions and settings etc.


My top extensions:

- prettier
- git lens
- import cost
- rainbow csv
- rainbow brackets
