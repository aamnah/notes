*tl;dr*: 

- You can't use Crashlytics in Expo without ejecting. [link](https://blog.expo.io/using-firebase-in-expo-e13844061832)
- You can use the [Firebase JS SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk) in Expo, but that only supports Database and Storage
- You can use [Firebase React Native](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) for full Firebase functionality, once you eject from Expo
