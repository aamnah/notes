excerpt: The Node.js version that comes pre-installed with Raspbian Jessie is old.
  If you check the version using `node -v`, it'll give you v0.10.29. The latest ARM-version
  of Node.js as of this writing is v4.2.1. Let's remove the old and install the latest
  version available on our Raspberry Pi

tl;dr
---

Run this one command in Terminal:

```bash
curl raw.githubusercontent.com/aamnah/bash-scripts/master/install_nodejs.sh | bash
```

This will automatically run a script i wrote that takes care of removing existing Node.js stuff, downloading and installing the latest version, and cleaning up afterwards. It also confirms the Node.js version once the installation is done.

The Node.js version that comes pre-installed with Raspbian Jessie is old. If you check the version using `node -v`, it'll give you v0.10.29. The latest ARM-version of Node.js as of this writing is v4.2.1. Let's remove the old and install the latest version available on our Raspberry Pi.

### Remove existing Node.js

Run the following commands one by one:

```shell
sudo apt remove -y nodered
sudo apt remove -y nodejs nodejs-legacy
sudo apt remove -y npm
```

### Install latest Node.js ARM-release

Download:

```bash
wget https://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
```

Install:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
```

That's it, you now have the latest Node.js version available for the Raspberry Pi. You can confirm the version using `node -v`.

### Re-install Node-RED

We uninstalled Node-RED as part of removing Node. If you want to re-install it, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nodered
```
