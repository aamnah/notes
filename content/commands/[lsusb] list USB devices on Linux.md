```bash
lsusb
```

The Mac equivalent [1][1] is 

```bash
system_profiler SPUSBDataType
```
    
For a visual alternative, the steps are:

- click the apple in the top left corner
choose _About This Mac_
- click on the _More Info…_ button to access the _System Information_ application
click on the _System Report…_ button
under _Hardware_ group, there’s the _USB_ option that we were searching for
