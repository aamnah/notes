title: Streams (stderr, stdin, stdout)

## stdin
Standard In. Whatever is entered into the bash terminal

## stdout
Standard Out. Whatever output was given back by the terminal.

## stderr
Standard Error. Whatever error was given back by the terminal

## Redirect stderr to /dev/null
You can redirect the `stderr` to `/dev/null` to get rid of it. You don't care if there are errors, you don't want to see those errors, you don't want to log those errors, you just want them gone.

```bash
ls avdkaeudvaev 2>> /dev/null
```

## Save both stderr and stdout 

```bash
ls fileThatExists fileThatDoesNotExist > mystdoutput 2> mystderror
```

will save the stdout in a file called _mystdoutput_ and save the stderr in a file called _mystderror_. We will get both stdout and stderr because we are listing a file that exists (stdout) and a file that doesn't exist which will result in an error (stderr). One command, one entry, two separate files.

## Uses:
- in bash scripts, you can supress outputting errors and log them to an error log instead.


## /dev/null 
/dev/null is _nothing_. It's a black hole. When you are redirecting something to /dev/null, you are basically telling it to get lost. And it will, get lost, in the nothnigness.
