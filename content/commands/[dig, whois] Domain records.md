## Registration details

`whois domain.com` will return domain registration details for domain.com, including when it was registered, who registered it, when it was created and who is the contact.

`dig` is another useful command. You can use the `dig +short` to only list values.

## Name Servers

```bash
whois aamnah.com | grep -i --color "Name Server:"
```

OR

```bash
dig NS aamnah.com
```

## NS, TXT, MX, SOA, SPF records
You can either pass the record as an argument

```bash
dig MX aamnah.com
```

![dig MX aamnah.com](/assets/img/cmd-dig-mx-2.png)

or use `grep` to find it in the output of `dig`

```bash
dig aamnah.com | grep --color "MX"
```
