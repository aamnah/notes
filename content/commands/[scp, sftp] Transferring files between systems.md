## SFTP: Secure FTP

By default, if we have openssh installed, we can use sftp.

Connect to a remote machine:

```bash

```

Once you have connected to a remote systems, you can copy files using `put`

For example:

```
sftp> put myFile
```

will put myFile on your local machine to the machine you are connected to.

- Both scp and sftp go over Port 22 by default.
