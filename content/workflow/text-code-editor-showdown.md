Right now i use 4 different editors.

- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime Text 3
- Brackets
- LightPaper

### Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code is **THE BEST editor if you want an IDE**. **Git, Terminal** offered out of the box.
- This is my go to editor for most projects
- Preferred editor of JavaScript (React) coders. Has support for things like JSX, Standard style etc.
- Supports Emmet out of the box
- Installing (and Disabling) Extensions is really easy and simple
- Git support is awesome. Committing code, seeing changes side by side, reverting changes, pushing code is all relatively fast and simple.
- Terminal is awesome. You can have multiple Terminals, all Terminals open in the project folder
- Highlights syntax in fenced code blocks in Markdown files
- An extension is available for [HTML/CSS/SCSS live preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Sublime Text 3
- The **multiple cursors** and **find and select all** are my favorite features
- Loads really fast
- Great for text editing

### Brackets
- Brackets is **THE BEST editor for CSS Styling**
- **LiveReload**s HTML/SCSS/CSS out of the box
- Live preview for your site, side by side editing, you immediately see every change you make
- Highlights all relevant areas on the page when you click a style

### LightPaper
- LightPaper is **THE BEST editor for Markdown**
- Live preview, see your changes side by side
- Code highlights, see syntax highlighting for all your fenced code. This is the one feature that i miss the most in other editors. Most editors highlight Markdown, but not code entered in code blocks (Sublime Text, Brackets).
- Scroll sync, keeps both screens on the same area when you scroll


#### Misc. things all editors support
- Emmet (have to install it separately in Sublime Text)
- Color highlights (Shows you the color for your color values)
- Multi-pane views
