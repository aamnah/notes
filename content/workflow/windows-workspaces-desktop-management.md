- **Task View** is awesome, this is what you should have gotten with `Alt`+ `Tab` by default imo. You get that with <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>. It's the same as pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd> on Ubuntu and doing a three finger swipe up on macOS to get **Mission Control**
- Workspaces are called _Desktops_ in Windows. They were introduced as virtual desktops in Windows 10
- Virtual desktops in Windows are still inferior to something like Ubuntu because there are no keyboard shortcuts to move applications between desktops
- Unlike Ubuntu, you can't search in Task View and you can't launch applications from Task View.
- If you **scroll on the Task bar** it'll switch between desktops!

| Keys                               | Description                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `Windows` + `Tab`                  | Task View                          |
| `Windows` + `Ctrl` + `D`           | Create a new Desktop               |
| `Windows` + `Ctrl` + `F4`          | Close a Desktop                    |
| `Windows` + `Ctrl` + `Arrow Left`  | Switch to the Desktop on the Left  |
| `Windows` + `Ctrl` + `Arrow Right` | Switch to the Desktop on the Right |

There don't seem to be any keyboard shortcuts for moving applications between Windows desktops. You have to drag and drop applications to the desktop you want from Task View. Projects like [Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Enhancer](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer) exist, but have been abandoned due to lack of interest/time. I tried installing them but the shortcuts to move applications didn't work. Same for the multiple forks of it from various people. Apparently it gets broken every time Windows updates.
