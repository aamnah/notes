title: The best of tiling window managers for Windows, macOS and Linux
---

### Features

These are the features i want

- **Edge snapping** (i want to be able to drag windows to rearrange+resize them. that's faster for me than remembering different keyboard shortcut and is basically the same way on all operating systems: you drag, you drop.)
- **Quarters** (i have 4K screens, plenty of space for me to have 1/4 or 1/6 of the screen area and still have full view of the app)
- **Custom layouts** (i'd like creating my own custom layouts by defining and saving _zones_. Not everything needs to be a quarter of the screen..)

My top 3 tools for resizing and arranging windows are as follows (all of these are free):

### Windows - FancyZones

I LOVE [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) on Windows. It's part of the [Microsoft PowerToys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) package and is completely free to use. Simple, powerful and easily customizable. You can create your own customized layouts and every monitor can have it's own layout.

### Ubuntu - ShellTile

For my use case, i settled on [ShellTile](https://github.com/emasab/shelltile) which is a GNOME extension and not an entirely new display manager. (Ubuntu uses GNOME by default)

[ShellTile](https://github.com/emasab/shelltile) lets you split windows to quarter and lower/upper half. There are keyboard shortcuts, and edge snapping if you drag the window while pressing `Ctrl`

ShellTile gives you 4 zones (left/right/upper/lower half) by keyboard shortcuts, and 8 zones (halves + quarters) with edge snapping when dragging windows
