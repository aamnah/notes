## Cut, copy and paste
You need to be in Visual mode `esc` then `v`

- `V` to select entire line
- `d` (aka delete) to cut it, `y` (aka yank) to copy it
- `p` to paste (after cursor)
- `P` to paste before cursor

## Switch between windows
e.g. you need to move between the NERDTree and Vim edit windows..

`ctrl + ww` to toggle between windows
`ctrl + w` then `l` to go to left window
`ctrl + w` then `h` to go to right window
