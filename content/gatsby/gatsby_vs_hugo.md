Gatsby

cons:

- needed me to create a `<Gist />` component just to be able to embed gists from Github
- more complex setup for beginners. If you're not a React developer, forget it
- custom file formats like `.jsx` and `.mdx`. Hugo files are just `.html` for templates and `.md` for posts
- because of custom formats, the content is not as portable as it is with Hugo. Moving into Gatsby is easy, i just copy my markdown content. Moving out could become a nightmare. Even with Hugo, if you search for migrating _from Hugo to WordPress_ you'll hardly get any results.
