A variable is any value that can change, or any value that you'll know later. Some examples of variable values:

- _Price_ is a variable, it can change for different items
- _Age_ is a variable, different people are of different ages
- _Name_ is a variable, different people have different names

They can be _strong, statically_ typed (C++, Java, Rust, Swift), or they can be _dynamically_ typed (Python, JavaScript)

Variables can be of different _types_

You may have to explicitly mention the _type_ or you may let the compiler _infer_ it (i.e. you can _imply_ that it's a string..)

- JavaScript has `const`, `let` and `var`. `let` is _block scope_, `const` is for values that don't change, and `var` is _function scoped_

```js
// JavaScript

// declaration
var name
let age
const year

// declaration + assignment
var myName = "Aamnah"
var myAwesomenessLevel = 1000
let isValid = true


var a, b, c, d // multiple declarations separated by coma
var a = "something",
    b = "some other things",
    c = true,
    d = 90 // multiple assignments separated by coma

let x = 10, y = 20
let total = x + y
```

```ts
// TypeScript
```

```bash
# Bash

```

```go
// Go
```

```csharp
// C#

```

```cpp
// C++

```
