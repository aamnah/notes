A variable is any value that can change, or any value that you'll know later. Some examples of variable values:

- _Price_ is a variable, it can change for different items
- _Age_ is a variable, different people are of different ages
- _Name_ is a variable, different people have different names

They can be _strictly_ typed, or they can be

Variables can be of different _types_

You may have to explicitly mention the _type_ or you may let the compiler _infer_ it (i.e. you can _imply_ that it's a string..)
