## About Me
Hi, i'm [Aamnah](http://aamnah.com). I'm a web developer and system administrator (wannabe). I'm a polyglot geek excited and fascinated by so many things. This is my blog of coding notes. The topics range from web development, programming, security, hacking, resources, unix/linux administration, code hacks and much more.

## About TLDR Dev Notes
Have you ever read a whole page just to get to the one line of code that does it all? Or had to re-read that saved note all over to check how something was done? I have, plenty of times.

Traditionally, the phrase **too long; didn't read** (abbreviated **tl;dr** or simply **tldr**) has been used on the Internet as a reply to an excessively long statement. It indicates that the reader did not actually read the statement due to its undue length.

A **tldr version** is basically a **short summarized version with only essential knowledge**. It is used to show a brief summary of a very long post/article.

TLDR Dev Notes is my collection of _tldr versions_ of my design and dev notes. No fluff, no details, no intros, just the commands i need to get it done.
