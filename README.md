# Aamnah's Notes

This combines all the notes from the various sites and from my local machine.

Previously, i have setup a site with Hugo, and another one with Gatsby. Both had different content. This repo combines the content from both those sites.

The idea with this repo is that it'll be used as a submodule for my portfolio site. Then it wouldn't matter what static site generator i use, i'll always be referencing this repo that contains just the notes and nothing else.
