# Aamnah's Blog

Gatsby based site for the blog on [blog.aamnah.com](https://blog.aamnah.com)

Uses MDX for the post content. I always had this issue where i couldn't use CSS classes in Makrdown, and if i did add any HTML, any markdown wouldn't render inside that HTML block. MDX fixes that. I can write in the Markdown that i am familiar with, and add all the jazz with JSX as well.

## TODO

- [x] Deploy the blog at Netlify
- [x] Get MDX posts working
- [ ] (in progress) Build a layout for posts
- [ ] (in progress) Build a layout for the Home page of the site
- [ ] (in progress) Add Recent posts tp the Home page
- [ ] Add sitemap
- [ ] Add RSS feed
- [ ] Figure out post images
- [ ] Fix post routes for MDX
- [ ] Add a component for inline SVGs

## Notes

- consider moving this blog to aamnah.com/blog, for SEO reasons. aamnah.com would then become the home page of this gatsby site..
