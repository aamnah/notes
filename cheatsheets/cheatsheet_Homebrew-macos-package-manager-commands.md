Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS, very much like `apt` is a package manager for Ubuntu/Debian Linux.

It lets you install, update, upgrade and uninstall programs via the command line. It also let's you install some Linux programs for your Mac, like `wget` for example.

Homebrew also let's you add programs to `launchd` so that they automatically start and restart with login. For example `brew services start mongodb`

install Homebrew with this command:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
